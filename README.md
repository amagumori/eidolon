# Eidolon

Eidolon is a project exploring procedural generation of architecture through a *descriptive language*, based on CGA / CGA++ ( Muller et al ), combined with a library of mesh operations.  Rather than performing boolean operations with mesh primitives this aims to be a way to procedurally describe vertex-level modeling operations on a mesh to create "recipes" for procedural generation.
